good job, but your functions will crash if passed a default-constructed mystring
I gave you a reference to the library function strcmp. *always* use library function to do standard things  
someone would be frustrated to wade through that code only to discover you've written your own version strcmp  
If you'd used strcmp, operator== will literally be one line of code.
